Two Dimensional arrays can be defined as arrays inside an array. The elements in a 2D array can be defined as rows and columns.
You can think of 2D arrays as N x M matrix.

2D arrays are created to implement a relational database lookalike data structure. It provides ease of holding the bulk of data at once which can be passed to any number of functions wherever required.

Some examples of 2D arrays are periodic table, movie ratings by multiple ratings on multiple movies, etc.

### When do you need 2D arrays?
These are some scenarios where 2D arrays are implemented:

*   Digital images.
*   Board games (Chess, Tic Tac Toe, Checkers).
*   Many games use 2D arrays to plot visual environment of a game.

### Anatomy of a 2D array
![Anatomy of 2D Array](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrpascal1/mrpascal1.github.io/master/imgs/2d-array1.png)
Let's take an example of a movie rating system where you will store movies as columns and reviewers as rows:
*   There are N rows and M columns in a 2D array.
*   Each row is a different reviewer and each column is a different movie, also you can see the indexing starts at 0.
*   The reviewer at the 0<sup>th</sup> index has given a rating of 4 to the Movie at the 0<sup>th</sup> index.
*   To get <b>4</b> from the array we write - <b>ratings[0][0]</b> where ratings is the array, the first subscript is a row and the second subscript is a column.
*   Similarly, to get <b>12</b> from the same array we can write - ratings[1][2]

### Creating 1D array vs 2D array
As a programmer, I believe you've already came across One-Dimensional arrays. We can create 1D array like:<br>
<code>
```python
# In python, we can use list to represent array.
# List index also start with 0
array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(array[0]) # Output: 1
```
</code>
Now, let's see how we can create 2D array:<br>

```python
# In python, we can use list[[],[]] (list of lists) to represent 2D array.
ratings = [[4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 12, 1], [10, 11, 3, 2]]

print(ratings[0][0]) # Output: 4
```

To find the length of a 2D array generally, we consider the number of rows present in it:
```python
# To find length of an array will use len() method.
print(len(ratings)) # Output: 3
```

Iterate over elements of a 2D array:<br>
```python
for i in range(len(ratings)): # i is the number of rows
    for j in range(len(ratings[i])): # j is the number of columns
        print(ratings[i][j], end=" ") # Output: 4 5 6 7 8 9 12 1 10 11 3 2
```

Now, let's see how you'll find the average rating for the movie in 2<sup>nd</sup> column:
```python
sum = 0
for row in range(len(ratings)):
    sum += ratings[row][2]
print(sum / len(ratings)) # 7.0
```

Similarly, how do we increment each reviewer rating by 2:
```python
for row in range(len(ratings)):
    for column in range(len(ratings[row])):
        ratings[row][column] += 2
print(ratings) # [[6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 14, 3], [12, 13, 5, 4]]
```

<b>Interview problem -</b> How will you rotate a given matrix?

```python
def rotateMatrix(matrix):
    if not len(matrix):
        return # return if matrix is empty
    top = 0
    bottom = len(matrix)-1
    left = 0
    right = len(matrix[0])-1

    while left < right and top < bottom:
        prev = matrix[top+1][left]

        # Moving elements of top row one step right
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            curr = matrix[top][i]
            matrix[top][i] = prev
            prev = curr
        top += 1

        # Moving elements of right column one step down
        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
            curr = matrix[i][right]
            matrix[i][right] = prev
            prev = curr
        right -= 1

        # Moving elements of bottom one step left:
        for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):
            curr = matrix[bottom][i]
            matrix[bottom][i] = prev
            prev = curr
        bottom -= 1
        
        # Moving elements of leftmost column one step up
        for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
            curr = matrix[i][left]
            matrix[i][left] = prev
            prev = curr
        left += 1
    return matrix

mat = [[4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 12, 1], [10, 11, 3, 2]]

print(rotateMatrix(mat)) # [[8, 4, 5, 6], [10, 9, 12, 7], [11, 3, 2, 1]]
```
