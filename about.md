## About me

I am a software engineer experienced with multiple tech stacks and am quite interested in android apps and backend engineering.<br>
<br>
I personally believe that good programmers are never limited by the tech stacks they have in memory but how well they can understand, learn and develop new things! I always find myself in situations where I know the most complicated stuff but end up Googling the simplest things and that is how development works.<br>
I can learn new stuff fairly quickly and build amazing things with it!

Apart from it, I have a passion for writing compilers and building operating systems which I try to do as much as possible whenever I get a chance.
